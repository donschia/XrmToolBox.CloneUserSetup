1. Click the `Open` button on the Source User or the Destination user to navigate to the user record in D365.  It defaults to the legacy interface where you can admin whatever you need to (Security Roles in particular).
If you want the newer UCI interface simply check the `Open Links in UCI Interface` box and then click the `Open` button.
